# Density Function (DF) Program

This program is part of the result of my [bachelor's thesis](https://mariuswenk.github.io/assets/pdf/BSc_thesis.pdf) in physics at TU Kaiserslautern "Transient optical response and density-evolution of valence electrons in copper after ultrafast laser-excitation". It is based on a program by my supervisor Pascal D. Ndione.

## Required libraries
* [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/)
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)

## Setup
* To run this project, use the following steps:

* 1 $ make clean

* 2 $ make 

* 3 $ bin/df_program

## Python Code
Python scripts in PythonFiles can be used to format some of the input and output data.

Run: $ python3 *`Filename`*.py


### Author 
This project is based on work of Pascal D. Ndione for the two-temperature model in gold. This version was created by Marius Wenk.
Python Files with m_*`Filename`*.py are created by Marius Wenk, the remaining ones by Pascal Ndione.
