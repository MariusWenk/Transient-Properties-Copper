# Density Function (DF) Program

This program is part of the result of my [bachelor's thesis](https://mariuswenk.github.io/assets/pdf/BSc_thesis.pdf) in physics at TU Kaiserslautern "Transient optical response and density-evolution of valence electrons in copper after ultrafast laser-excitation". It is based on a program by my supervisor Pascal D. Ndione.

The program predicts how ultrashort laser pulses affect the electronic and optical properties of copper based on the two-temperature model. After laser excitation, conduction electrons rapidly thermalize into a hot Fermi distribution, but band occupation remains out of equilibrium. Using a two-temperature model and rate equations for 4sp- and 3d-electrons, non-equilibrium electron dynamics are simulated. The resulting occupation and temperature data are used to compute the time-resolved dielectric function via the Drude-Lorentz formalism. These simulations help predict transient optical properties such as reflectivity and transmissivity, which can be compared with experimental data.
Studying the predictions, I found a high impact of initial dielectric function parameters and density of states on copperâ€™s relaxation behavior, showing that assuming rapid electron thermalization provides a reasonable optical response model.
